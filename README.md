# Face-Detection-Tracking-Blurring-System
Built a real-time face detection and blurring system using YOLO and OpenCV. Designed a Python GUI that allows users to upload videos, select specific faces, and apply blurring dynamically. Optimized object tracking to maintain consistent ID mapping throughout the video.
